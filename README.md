# Chatify

A real time chat app build using react, tailwind css , and firebase with google authentication for webapp.


# Process
I just wanted to create a simple app using firebase but i didn't know that the data structure would be so complicated. it was a great learning process and i will be back later to improve this project.



# How it can be improved?
It was my first project with firebase so there are some bugs which I might try solving later on.
- The chats data isn't shown when user re-logins which creates a sort of error. 
- need to add a homepage for when the user hasn't opened any chat which says something like "start a message"
- need to make the UI more interactive and make it mobile responsive
- add feature for media sharing and customize user profile.
